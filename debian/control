Description: security-focused general purpose memory allocator
 This is a security-focused general purpose memory allocator providing the
 malloc API along with various extensions. It provides substantial hardening
 against heap corruption vulnerabilities. The security-focused design also
 leads to much less metadata overhead and memory waste from fragmentation than
 a more traditional allocator design. It aims to provide decent overall
 performance with a focus on long-term performance and memory usage rather than
 allocator micro-benchmarks. It offers scalability via a configurable number of
 entirely independently arenas, with the internal locking within arenas further
 divided up per size class.
 .
 It can be added as a preloaded library using /etc/ld.so.preload.
